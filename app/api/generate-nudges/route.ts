                            Client Profile:
                            - Monthly Spending: R ${userData.monthlySpending}

                            - Emergency Fund (months): ${userData.emergencyFund}
                            - Account Balance: R ${userData.accountBalance}

                            Generate nudges that are:
                            1. Specific to their spending patterns
                            2. Prioritized by impact (high priority = biggest potential savings)
                            3. Actionable (they can implement today/this week)
                            4. South Africa-specific (use RSA context, mention Investec when relevant)
                            5. Behavioral (focus on fostering better financial habits)

                            Include a mix of:
                            - Subscription audits and optimization

                            - Emergency fund building
                            - Passive income opportunities
